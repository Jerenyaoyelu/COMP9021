    "Now that the program of the TM has been captured in a form that seems appropriate for further use, we can write code to simulate computation. Recall that __tape__ represents only a finite section of the tape. As computation progresses, larger and larger sections of the tape are potentially explored, possibly requiring to extend __tape__ accordingly, left or right. The widget does this. Here, in order to simplify our task, we assume that __tape__ is defined in such a way that it is large enough and contains enough __0__'s at both ends for the head of the TM not to go beyond the section determined by __tape__, for the input under consideration, so there are enough __0__'s left and right of the __1__'s in __tape__ that encode the input for all instructions to be executed within __tape__'s boundaries. With this in mind, and knowing how the division by 2 program works, let us set __tape__ as follows, so set for an input of 7:"
